# EDA Analysis of Retail Store's Data Using PySpark

- This project is an `exploratory data analysis` of retail data utilizing `PySpark` to uncover hidden insights that can increase sales. 
- The analysis allows the store manager to understand which products require more attention, track individual product performance, identify top-selling items, and adjust inventory levels accordingly. 
- Retailers can also use sales data to analyze customer purchasing patterns and make informed decisions about product placement, promotions, and pricing strategies.

pip install pyspark
```

# Usage
To use this project, simply run the `retail_eda_analysis.py` script using PySpark. The script reads in the retail data from a CSV file and performs various data manipulation and analysis tasks using PySpark functions such as join, groupBy, withColumn, partitionBy, and Windows functions like rank and dense rank. The output of each task is printed to the console, along with any relevant analysis and insights.
